The Generative AI Newsletter Application sample is a ready-to-use serverless solution designed to allow users to create rich newsletters automatically with content summaries that are AI-generated. 

The application offers users the ability to influence the generative AI prompts to customize how content is summarized such as the tone, intended audience, and more. Users can stylize the HTML newsletter, define how frequently newsletters are created and share the newsletters with others.
